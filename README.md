# Authentication API - allows users to SignUp and SignIn
Problem: Implement a simple account/authentication service.  At a minimum, the application should be able to create a user account, look-up a user, and authenticate a user via password.  Demo sample http requests/responses for each of the APIs.

#Build a Demo Spring Boot Authentication services with features:
1. User can Signup new Account
2. User can SignIn by providing username, password and generated token
3. User can access specific user details by username
4. User can access Welcome page by passing security token generated by the system (Authorization)

#Technology used
1. Spring Boot
2. Spring Secutity
3. JWT
4. MySQL


#APIs
1. POST /user/signup  Registers new user
2. POST /user/signin  Signs in new user
3. GET /user/{username} Gets user by name
4. POST /user/token Gets a JWT token for the user to access other resources
5. GET /welcome     Gets the sample Welcome page by using the token generated
